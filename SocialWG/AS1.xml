      <verb name="author">Indicates that the actor has authored the object. Note that this
          is a more specific form of the verb "create".</verb>
      <verb name="authorize">Indicates that the actor has authorized the object. If a target
          is specified, it means that the authorization is specifically in 
          regards to the target. For instance, a service can authorize a 
          person to access a given application; in which case the actor is the
          service, the object is the person, and the target is the application.
          In contrast, a person can authorize a request; in which case the 
          actor is the person and the object is the request and there might be 
          no explicit target.</verb>
      <verb name="borrow">Indicates that the actor has borrowed the object. If a target
          is specified, it identifies the entity from which the object was 
          borrowed. For instance, if a person borrows a book from a library,

      <verb name="consume">Indicates that the actor has consumed the object. The 
          specific meaning is dependent largely on the object's type.
          For instance, an actor may "consume" an audio object, indicating
          that the actor has listened to it; or an actor may "consume"
          a book, indicating that the book has been read. As such, the

          instance, a person checking-in to a Place.</verb>

      <verb name="disagree">Indicates that the actor disagrees with the object.</verb>
      <verb name="dislike">Indicates that the actor dislikes the object. Note that the 
          "dislike" verb is distinct from the "unlike" verb which assumes
          that the object had been previously "liked".</verb>
      <verb name="experience">Indicates that the actor has experienced the object in some 
          manner. Note that, depending on the specific object types used 
          for both the actor and object, the meaning of this verb can 
          overlap that of the "consume" and "play" verbs. For instance, 
          a person might "experience" a movie; or "play" the movie; or "consume"
          the movie. The "experience" verb can be considered a more generic
          form of other more specific verbs as "consume", "play", "watch", 
          "listen", and "read"</verb>

         <spanx style="verb">follow</spanx>
      </verb>
      <verb name="follow">Indicates that the actor began following the activity of the 
          object. In most cases, the objectType will be a "person", but it can 
          potentially be of any type that can sensibly generate activity.
          Processors MAY ignore (silently drop) successive identical "follow" 
          activities.</verb>
      <verb name="give">Indicates that the actor is giving an object to the target.
          Examples include one person giving a <spanx style="verb">badge</spanx>
          object to another person. The <spanx style="verb">object</spanx>
          identifies the object being given. The <spanx style="verb">target</spanx>

          in which case the object may be the <spanx style="verb">request-friend</spanx>
          activity.</verb>
      <verb name="request-friend">
         <spanx style="verb">insert</spanx>

      <verb name="insert">Indicates that the actor has inserted the object into the target.</verb>

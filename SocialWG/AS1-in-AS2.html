            <h2>Activity Streams 1.0 Verbs</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>accept: Indicates that the actor has accepted the object. For 
                  instance, a person accepting an award, or accepting an assignment.
               </li>
               <li>access: Indicates that the actor has accessed the object. For instance,
                  a person accessing a room, or accessing a file.
               </li>
               <li>acknowledge: Indicates that the actor has acknowledged the object. This 
                  effectively signals that the actor is aware of the object's
                  existence.
               </li>
               <li>add: Indicates that the actor has added the object to the target. 
                  For instance, adding a photo to an album.
               </li>
               <li>agree: Indicates that the actor agrees with the object. For example, 
                  a person agreeing with an argument, or expressing agreement with
                  a particular issue.
               </li>
               <li>append: Indicates that the actor has appended the object to the target.
                  For instance, a person appending a new record to a database.
               </li>
               <li>approve: Indicates that the actor has approved the object. For instance,
                  a manager might approve a travel request.
               </li>
               <li>archive: Indicates that the actor has archived the object.</li>
               <li>assign: Indicates that the actor has assigned the object to the target.</li>
               <li>at: Indicates that the actor is currently located at the object. For 
                  instance, a person being at a specific physical location.
               </li>
               <li>attach: Indicates that the actor has attached the object to the target.
                  For instance, a person attaching a file to a wiki page or an email.
               </li>
               <li>attend: Indicates that the actor has attended the object. For instance,
                  a person attending a meeting.
               </li>
               <li>author: Indicates that the actor has authored the object. Note that this
                  is a more specific form of the verb "create".
               </li>
               <li>authorize: Indicates that the actor has authorized the object. If a target
                  is specified, it means that the authorization is specifically in 
                  regards to the target. For instance, a service can authorize a 
                  person to access a given application; in which case the actor is the
                  service, the object is the person, and the target is the application.
                  In contrast, a person can authorize a request; in which case the 
                  actor is the person and the object is the request and there might be 
                  no explicit target.
               </li>
               <li>borrow: Indicates that the actor has borrowed the object. If a target
                  is specified, it identifies the entity from which the object was 
                  borrowed. For instance, if a person borrows a book from a library,
                  the person is the actor, the book is the object and the library 
                  is the target.
               </li>
               <li>build: Indicates that the actor has built the object. For example, 
                  if a person builds a model or compiles code.
               </li>
               <li>cancel: Indicates that the actor has canceled the object. For 
                  instance, canceling a calendar event.
               </li>
               <li>close: Indicates that the actor has closed the object. For instance,
                  the object could represent a ticket being tracked in an issue
                  management system.
               </li>
               <li>complete: Indicates that the actor has completed the object.</li>
               <li>confirm: Indicates that the actor has confirmed or agrees with the object.
                  For instance, a software developer might confirm an issue reported
                  against a product.
               </li>
               <li>consume: Indicates that the actor has consumed the object. The 
                  specific meaning is dependent largely on the object's type.
                  For instance, an actor may "consume" an audio object, indicating
                  that the actor has listened to it; or an actor may "consume"
                  a book, indicating that the book has been read. As such, the 
                  "consume" verb is a more generic form of other more specific 
                  verbs such as "read" and "play".
               </li>
               <li>checkin: Indicates that the actor has checked-in to the object. For 
                  instance, a person checking-in to a Place.
               </li>
               <li>create: Indicates that the actor has created the object.</li>
               <li>delete: Indicates that the actor has deleted the object. This 
                  implies, but does not require, the permanent destruction of the 
                  object.
               </li>
               <li>deliver: Indicates that the actor has delivered the object. For example,
                  delivering a package.
               </li>
               <li>deny: Indicates that the actor has denied the object. For example,
                  a manager may deny a travel request.
               </li>
               <li>disagree: Indicates that the actor disagrees with the object.</li>
               <li>dislike: Indicates that the actor dislikes the object. Note that the 
                  "dislike" verb is distinct from the "unlike" verb which assumes
                  that the object had been previously "liked".
               </li>
               <li>experience: Indicates that the actor has experienced the object in some 
                  manner. Note that, depending on the specific object types used 
                  for both the actor and object, the meaning of this verb can 
                  overlap that of the "consume" and "play" verbs. For instance, 
                  a person might "experience" a movie; or "play" the movie; or "consume"
                  the movie. The "experience" verb can be considered a more generic
                  form of other more specific verbs as "consume", "play", "watch", 
                  "listen", and "read"
               </li>
               <li>favorite: Indicates that the actor marked the object as an item of 
                  special interest.
               </li>
               <li>find: Indicates that the actor has found the object.</li>
               <li>flag-as-inappropriate: Indicates that the actor has flagged the object as being 
                  inappropriate for some reason. When using this verb, the 
                  context property, as specified 
                  within  can be used to 
                  provide additional detail about why the object has been 
                  flagged.
               </li>
               <li>context: follow</li>
               <li>follow: Indicates that the actor began following the activity of the 
                  object. In most cases, the objectType will be a "person", but it can 
                  potentially be of any type that can sensibly generate activity.
                  Processors MAY ignore (silently drop) successive identical "follow" 
                  activities.
               </li>
               <li>give: Indicates that the actor is giving an object to the target.
                  Examples include one person giving a badge
                  object to another person. The object
                  identifies the object being given. The target
                  identifies the receiver.
               </li>
               <li>badge: host</li>
               <li>object: host</li>
               <li>target: host</li>
               <li>host: Indicates that the actor is hosting the object. As in hosting 
                  an event, or hosting a service.
               </li>
               <li>ignore: Indicates that the actor has ignored the object. For instance, 
                  this verb may be used when an actor has ignored a friend request, 
                  in which case the object may be the request-friend
                  activity.
               </li>
               <li>request-friend: insert</li>
               <li>insert: Indicates that the actor has inserted the object into the target.</li>
               <li>install: Indicates that the actor has installed the object, as in 
                  installing an application.
               </li>
               <li>interact: Indicates that the actor has interacted with the object. For instance,
                  when one person interacts with another.
               </li>
               <li>invite: Indicates that the actor has invited the object, typically a 
                  person object, to join or participate in the object described by
                  the target. The target could, for instance,
                  be an event, group or a service.
               </li>
               <li>target: join</li>
               <li>join: Indicates that the actor has become a member of the object. This 
                  specification only defines the meaning of this verb when the 
                  object of the Activity has an
                  objectType of group, 
                  though implementors need to be prepared to handle other types of objects.
               </li>
               <li>object: leave</li>
               <li>objectType: leave</li>
               <li>group: leave</li>
               <li>leave: Indicates that the actor has left the object. For instance, 
                  a Person leaving a Group or checking-out of a Place.
               </li>
               <li>like: Indicates that the actor marked the object as an item of special 
                  interest. The "like" verb is considered to be an alias of "favorite". 
                  The two verb are semantically identical.
               </li>
               <li>listen: Indicates that the actor has listened to the object. This is typically
                  only applicable for objects representing audio content, such as music,
                  an audio-book, or a radio broadcast. The "listen" verb is a more specific
                  form of the "consume", "experience" and "play" verbs.
               </li>
               <li>lose: Indicates that the actor has lost the object. For instance, if a 
                  person loses a game.
               </li>
               <li>make-friend: Indicates the creation of a friendship that is reciprocated by 
                  the object. Since this verb implies an activity on the part of its object,
                  processors MUST NOT accept activities with this verb unless they are
                  able to verify through some external means that there is in fact a
                  reciprocated connection. For example, a processor may have received
                  a guarantee from a particular publisher that the publisher will only
                  use this Verb in cases where a reciprocal relationship exists.
               </li>
               <li>open: Indicates that the actor has opened the object. For instance,
                  the object could represent a ticket being tracked in an issue
                  management system.
               </li>
               <li>play: Indicates that the actor spent some time enjoying the object. 
                  For example, if the object is a video this indicates that the subject 
                  watched all or part of the video. The "play" verb is a more specific 
                  form of the "consume" verb.
               </li>
               <li>present: Indicates that the actor has presented the object. For instance,
                  when a person gives a presentation at a conference.
               </li>
               <li>purchase: Indicates that the actor has purchased the object. If a target is
                  specified, in indicates the entity from which the object was purchased.
               </li>
               <li>qualify: Indicates that the actor has qualified for the object. If a target
                  is specified, it indicates the context within which the qualification
                  applies.
               </li>
               <li>read: Indicates that the actor read the object. This is typically only
                  applicable for objects representing printed or written content, such 
                  as a book, a message or a comment. The "read" verb is a more specific
                  form of the "consume", "experience" and "play" verbs.
               </li>
               <li>receive: Indicates that the actor is receiving an object.
                  Examples include a person receiving a badge
                  object. The object
                  identifies the object being received.
               </li>
               <li>badge: reject</li>
               <li>object: reject</li>
               <li>reject: Indicates that the actor has rejected the object.</li>
               <li>remove: Indicates that the actor has removed the object from the target.</li>
               <li>remove-friend: Indicates that the actor has removed the object from the collection
                  of friends.
               </li>
               <li>replace: Indicates that the actor has replaced the target with the object.</li>
               <li>request: Indicates that the actor has requested the object. If a target is
                  specified, it indicates the entity from which the object is being 
                  requested.
               </li>
               <li>request-friend: Indicates the creation of a friendship that has not yet been reciprocated by 
                  the object.
               </li>
               <li>resolve: Indicates that the actor has resolved the object. For instance,
                  the object could represent a ticket being tracked in an issue
                  management system.
               </li>
               <li>return: Indicates that the actor has returned the object. If a target is
                  specified, it indicates the entity to which the object was returned.
               </li>
               <li>retract: Indicates that the actor has retracted the object. For instance,
                  if an actor wishes to retract a previously published activity, 
                  the object would be the previously published activity that is being
                  retracted.
               </li>
               <li>rsvp-maybe: The "possible RSVP" verb indicates that the actor has made a
                  possible RSVP for the object. This specification only defines the
                  meaning of this verb when its object is an event (see ), though implementors need
                  to be prepared to
                  handle other object types. The use of this verb is only appropriate 
                  when the RSVP was created by an explicit action by the actor. It 
                  is not appropriate to use this verb when a user has been added as 
                  an attendee by an event organiser or administrator.
               </li>
               <li>rsvp-no: The "negative RSVP" verb indicates that the actor has made a
                  negative RSVP for the object. This specification only defines the
                  meaning of this verb when its object is an event (see ), though implementors need
                  to be prepared to
                  handle other object types. The use of this verb is only appropriate 
                  when the RSVP was created by an explicit action by the actor. It is 
                  not appropriate to use this verb when a user has been added as an 
                  attendee by an event organiser or administrator.
               </li>
               <li>rsvp-yes: The "positive RSVP" verb indicates that the actor has made a
                  positive RSVP for an object. This specification only defines the
                  meaning of this verb when its object is an event (see ), though implementors need
                  to be prepared to
                  handle other object types. The use of this verb is only appropriate 
                  when the RSVP was created by an explicit action by the actor. It 
                  is not appropriate to use this verb when a user has been added as 
                  an attendee by an event organiser or administrator.

                  interest primarily to him- or herself. Though this action MAY be 
                  shared publicly, the implication is that the object has been saved 
                  primarily for the actor's own benefit rather than to show it to 
                  others as would be indicated by the "share" verb.

               </li>
               <li>sponsor: Indicates that the actor has sponsored the object. If a target
                  is specified, it indicates the context within which the sponsorship

                  For example, if the actor specifies that a particular user

                  is specified, it indicates the context within which the object was not
                  satisfied. For instance, if a person fails to satisfy the requirements 
                  of some particular challenge, the person is the actor; the requirement 
                  is the object and the challenge is the target.

               <li>unsave: Indicates that the actor has removed the object from the collection
